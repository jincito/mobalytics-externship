## [Pyramid Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elMPIxLYtoc)
- Establish your main point followed by 2-3 key arguments and then the supporting points.
- Each box is meant to capture the main point of all the boxes below it.
- Say the answer up front so the listener can decide if its something they agree with.
- Makes the argument easy to follow. Make the audience understand your main point and how you reached it.

Step 1: Prepare a script that will be the “narration” of your presentation.
For each slide write a paragraph or two that will build upon the text you have added on the slide. This paragraph should be long enough and short enough that it can be delivered within the suggested time.

Step 2: Practice, Practice, Practice
You can practice your narration independently using a software called [Yoodli](https://app.yoodli.ai/). Yoodli is an AI-powered software that you can use to improve your communication skills with private, real-time, and judgement free coaching.
