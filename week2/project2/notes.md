## GAME 1 ~ PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS
- Genre: Battle Royale, Tactical Shooter; arcade shooter based on bullet physics
  
- Release date: March 23, 2017
  
- Platforms on which the game is available (support console, desktop, mobile, all platforms):
  All platforms
  
- Gameplay mechanics (Core gameplay elements, including game objectives, and strategies commonly employed by players):
  Players must constantly decide where to move next as the play zone shrinks. Deciding when and where to rotate, whether to take a vehicle or travel on foot, and whether to engage in firefights or avoid them are all critical decisions. The shrinking safe zone forces players to make strategic choices about when to stay hidden and when to move toward key areas. Early in the game, players must decide which areas to loot, weighing the risk of encountering enemies against the reward of gathering essential weapons, armor, and healing items. 
  
- Gameplay (interface, controls, game physics, character movement, and interaction with the game environment.):
  The HUD displays a health bar, weapon inventory, minimap, and ammo count. A large open-world map is accessible to plan routes, view safe zones, and identify enemies using pings. In-game, the user can view various contextual markers like damage, footsteps, and shots to give situational awareness.
  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs): [Essential metrics that measure player performance, such as kills, deaths, assists, objectives captured, or gold earned, depending on the game genre. This can be something as simple as levels past, items collected, etc. in more single-player games.]

- In-game decision-making: (How players make decisions during matches and identify patterns or strategies that contribute to success or failure in different game scenarios)
  As the match progresses, players must manage their resources effectively (ammo, healing items) and make quick decisions about which items to prioritize. Successful players often develop strategies around survival (playing the edge of the zone, avoiding early fights) or aggression (seeking out enemies to eliminate and loot). Understanding when to switch between these approaches is key. High-level players frequently monitor the map for supply drops, high ground advantages, or cover, making decisions based on terrain and safe zone movement. Risk-reward analysis such as whether to loot exposed areas, whether to revive a teammate under fire, or when to use high-value resources like health packs.

  PUBG Corporation and KRAFTON
  Free-to-play with in-game purchases.
  Cosmetics like weapon skins and player outfits are the main incentive. Players receive free items upon leveling up.

- Why did you choose to play this game?/ What motivated you to play this game?
  Always been a fan of engaging battle royales like Fortnite. Looter shooters that have the core objective of surviving until the last player have been one of my favorite genres for a while. I play games that require situational awareness(video and audio) and high risk high reward.

## GAME 2 ~ Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
- Genre: Competitive tactical shooter

- Release date: December 1, 2015
  
- Platforms on which the game is available (support console, desktop, mobile, all platforms):
  All platforms
  
- Gameplay mechanics (Core gameplay elements, including game objectives, and strategies commonly employed by players):
  Each operator has their unique "special gadgets" and passive abilities as well as different movement speed and armor. You are thrown into a 5v5 strategic map that requires teamwork to plant bombs, rescue hostages, hold a position and defend. Each time you die, you learn something and take it to the next round. Each round you need to adjust your team's strategy to attack or defend an objective. Using the operators abilities to slow attackers or push through fortifications, teamwork is highly valuable. In game voice commands or voice chat options are available to give you and your team the strategic advantage. It is really rewarding when the team executes a plan to attack and plant the bomb.
  
- Gameplay (interface, controls, game physics, character movement, and interaction with the game environment.):
  The interface is more streamlined, focusing on objective-based icons (bombs, hostages) and tactical information like operator gadgets and loadouts. The HUD shows critical details like health, ammo, and teammates' status, while also providing a small minimap. Information about enemies is limited to what you gather through observation or specific gadgets (e.g., cameras, drones).
  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs): [Essential metrics that measure player performance, such as kills, deaths, assists, objectives captured, or gold earned, depending on the game genre. This can be something as simple as levels past, items collected, etc. in more single-player games.]
  Metrics are covered in Kills/Deaths/Assists with a point system that rewards operators using their gadgets, defenders using fortifications, attackers destroying their environment, and of course, capturing/defending the objective.
  
- In-game decision-making: (How players make decisions during matches and identify patterns or strategies that contribute to success or failure in different game scenarios)
  Decision-making starts before the match even begins, as players must choose operators whose abilities fit the team composition and the specific map or game mode. Choosing the wrong operator or failing to use gadgets effectively can limit the team's options. Decisions include where to reinforce walls, where to set traps or cameras, and when to push into enemy territory. Proper positioning allows for ambushes, flank control, and coverage of important areas. Constant communication with teammates including when and how to breach, where to place defensive equipment, or when to rotate to defend or attack different objectives.

- Game Developer & Revenue model (free-to-play with in-game purchases, a one-time purchase, or requires a subscription):
  Ubisoft. In-game purchases including Battle Pass Membership, XP Boosters, [R6 Marketplace](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/marketplace): Exchange items for credits or get a skin from a previous season

- Why did you choose to play this game?/ What motivated you to play this game?
  Tactical shooters have always been around in my arsenal of games. Coming from CSGO 2/Valorant I took this game very seriously. I have over 1000 hours spread between competetive/ranked modes, consoles, and PC.  Choosing the game was also a must since the developers stated that next season (Year 9 Season 4) it will be cross-platform between consoles and PC. I myself poured hours into the PC version but have also used the sticks on Xbox and PS4. In season 4, Rainbow Six Siege will allow console players to play with their PC friends. Console players will be matched with PC players, not vice versa. PC players, like myself, will finally play with friends on consoles and I am sure the amount of players will top the charts.

In PUBG, decision-making revolves around adaptability and resource management, with a focus on positioning and engagement strategies in a large, open-world environment. Rainbow Six Siege, on the other hand, emphasizes tactical planning, team coordination, and strategic use of the environment through destructible map features. Success in PUBG often depends on a playerâ€™s ability to weigh risks and rewards in constantly changing situations, while in Siege, players must work as a team, gathering and reacting to real-time intel to outsmart their opponents. Both games reward methodical thinking and the ability to read and react to the flow of the match.

While PUBG focuses on large-scale battles with survival mechanics and open-world exploration, Rainbow Six Siege is a much more compact, tactical shooter where every interaction with the environment is crucial to the outcome of a round. Both games emphasize strategy and skill, but Siege leans heavily on coordinated team play and environmental manipulation, whereas PUBG revolves around adaptability in an ever-changing battleground.
