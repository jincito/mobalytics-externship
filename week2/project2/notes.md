## GAME 2 ~ Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
- Genre: Competitive tactical shooter

- Release date: December 1, 2015
  
- Platforms on which the game is available (support console, desktop, mobile, all platforms):
  All platforms
  
- Gameplay mechanics (Core gameplay elements, including game objectives, and strategies commonly employed by players):
  Each operator has their unique "special gadgets" and passive abilities as well as different movement speed and armor. You are thrown into a 5v5 strategic map that requires teamwork to plant bombs, rescue hostages, hold a position and defend. Each time you die, you learn something and take it to the next round. Each round you need to adjust your team's strategy to attack or defend an objective. Using the operators abilities to slow attackers or push through fortifications, teamwork is highly valuable. In game voice commands or voice chat options are available to give you and your team the strategic advantage. It is really rewarding when the team executes a plan to attack and plant the bomb.
  
- Gameplay (interface, controls, game physics, character movement, and interaction with the game environment.):
  The interface is more streamlined, focusing on objective-based icons (bombs, hostages) and tactical information like operator gadgets and loadouts. The HUD shows critical details like health, ammo, and teammates' status, while also providing a small minimap. Information about enemies is limited to what you gather through observation or specific gadgets (e.g., cameras, drones).
  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs): [Essential metrics that measure player performance, such as kills, deaths, assists, objectives captured, or gold earned, depending on the game genre. This can be something as simple as levels past, items collected, etc. in more single-player games.]
  Metrics are covered in Kills/Deaths/Assists with a point system that rewards operators using their gadgets, defenders using fortifications, attackers destroying their environment, and of course, capturing/defending the objective.
  
- In-game decision-making: (How players make decisions during matches and identify patterns or strategies that contribute to success or failure in different game scenarios)

- Game Developer & Revenue model (free-to-play with in-game purchases, a one-time purchase, or requires a subscription):
  In-game purchases including Battle Pass Membership, XP Boosters, [R6 Marketplace](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/marketplace): Exchange items for credits or get a skin from a previous season

- Why did you choose to play this game?/ What motivated you to play this game?
  Tactical shooters have always been around in my arsenal of games. Coming from CSGO 2/Valorant I took this game very seriously. I have over 1000 hours spread between competetive/ranked modes, consoles, and PC.  Choosing the game was also a must since the developers stated that next season (Year 9 Season 4) it will be cross-platform between consoles and PC. I myself poured hours into the PC version but have also used the sticks on Xbox and PS4. In season 4, Rainbow Six Siege will allow console players to play with their PC friends. Console players will be matched with PC players, not vice versa. PC players, like myself, will finally play with friends on consoles and I am sure the amount of players will top the charts.

In PUBG, decision-making revolves around adaptability and resource management, with a focus on positioning and engagement strategies in a large, open-world environment. Rainbow Six Siege, on the other hand, emphasizes tactical planning, team coordination, and strategic use of the environment through destructible map features. Success in PUBG often depends on a playerâ€™s ability to weigh risks and rewards in constantly changing situations, while in Siege, players must work as a team, gathering and reacting to real-time intel to outsmart their opponents. Both games reward methodical thinking and the ability to read and react to the flow of the match.

While PUBG focuses on large-scale battles with survival mechanics and open-world exploration, Rainbow Six Siege is a much more compact, tactical shooter where every interaction with the environment is crucial to the outcome of a round. Both games emphasize strategy and skill, but Siege leans heavily on coordinated team play and environmental manipulation, whereas PUBG revolves around adaptability in an ever-changing battleground.
